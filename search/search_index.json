Benefits Observability on a single platform across applications and infrastructure Easiest way to collect metrics in AWS on-premise Imprive operational performance and resources optimization Get oeprational visibility and insights Derive actionable insights from logs How it works Collect Monitor Act Analyse Features Listing Collect Collect logs from EC2 instances On-premise servers VPC Flow Logs AWS CloudTrail AWS Lambda Other AWS Services Built in metrics EC2 DynamoDB S3 ECS Lambda APi Gateway and more than 70 AWS services Custom metrics publish metrics using AWS CLI or an API Standard resolution with one-minute granularity Collect and aggregate container metrics CPU RAM Disk Network Automatic Dashboards Set alarms on metrics Unified operational view with dashboards A single view for selected metrics and alarms Multiple AWS accounts and multiple regions ... High resolution alarms Amazon CloudWatch alarms allow you to srt a threshold on metrics and trigger an action Watch a single metric or the result of a match expression Perform actions based on the value of metrics Send a notification to an SNS topic Auto Scaling action EC2 Action (Stop, Terminate, Reboot or Recover) Add alarms to dashboard to visualize them Logs and metrics correlation Amazon CloudWatch also makes it wasy to correlate metrics and logs. Manage logs and metrics in a single platform Use metric filters to convert logs to metrics Anomaly Detection When you enable anomaly detection for a metric, ClodWatch applies machine learning algorithms to the metric's past data to create a model of the metric'S expected values. Create alarms that auto-adjust thresholds based on natural metric patterns Alarm when the metric value is above or below the band, or both Visualize metrics with anomaly detection bands on dashboards ServiceLens You can use CloudWatch ServiceLens to visualize and analyze the health, performance ans availability of your applications in a single place. Integrates CloudWatch witch AWS X-Ray to provide an ent-to-end view of your application A service map displays your service endpoints and resources as \"nodes\" and highlite the traffic, latency and errors for each node and its connections You can choose a node to see details Synthetics Run tests on your endpoints everyminute, 24x7 and alerts you as soon as your application endpoints don't behave as expected. View of your customers' experience Configureable scripts Run once Run on schedule Check availability and latency Store load time data Store screenshots Auto Scaling Auto Scaling helps you automate capacity and resource planning.
