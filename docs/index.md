## AWS Certified Solutions Architect Professional Notes


The purpose of this site is to provide a well structured source of notes that I've taken in preparation for the 2020 Edition of the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Professional exam.

This site is generated and hosted using the following technologies:

* MkDocs: For turning vanilla Markdown into the beautiful site that you see before you.
* Material for MkDocs: To add Material styling on top of MkDocs
* Github Pages: for hosting

Disclaimer: This site is meant for training purposes only. It is built using notes taken during the A Cloud Guru - AWS Certified Solutions Architect Professkional course and other materials. Many of the notes presented on this site are directly from that course.

Idea, texts and inspiration taken from [brandonavant.com](https://brandonavant.com/).
